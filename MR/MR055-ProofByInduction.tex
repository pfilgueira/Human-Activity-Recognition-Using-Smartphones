Mathematical Induction is a special way of proving things. It has only 2 steps:
\begin{description}
\item[Step 1.] Show it is true for the first one
\item[Step 2.] Show that if any one is true then the next one is true
\end{description}
Then all are true
\end{frame}

Step 2 is best done this way:

\begin{itemize}
\item Assume it is true for n=k
\item Prove it is true for n=k+1 (we can use the n=k case as a fact.)
\end{itemize}

Step 2 can often be tricky ... because we may need to use imaginative tricks to make it work! 

The word "proof" should be taken to mean something more like ``test".
