 MA4004 - Hypothesis Testing
 
 
 
The four key elements of this are
 
1) formally stating the Null and Alternative hypotheses
2) determine the test statistic value
    This is based on the data given in the question , and the formulae at the back of the exam paper
3) Determining the critical value for the test
     This depends on
        the sample size 'n'  ( and hence the degree of freedom ),
        the number of tails 'k' ,
        and the required significance level .
4) Employing the Decision Rule
        This compares the absolute value of the test statistic and the critical value.
