Suppose a gambler is playing a simple coin flip game. The gambler does not know that the coin has been tampered with such that the probability of a Head is 47\%.

Suppose the gamble plays this coin flip game nine times. What is the probability that he wins precisely 3 times.

Jobs are sent to a printer at an average of 5 jobs per hour. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item (1 Mark)  What is the expected time between jobs? 
\item (1 Mark)  What is the probability that the next job is sent within 6 minutes after the previous job?
\end{enumerate}
