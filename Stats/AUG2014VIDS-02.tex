Q1

A multinational corporation (MNC) has two manufacturing facilities – one in Limerick, the other in Texas, both producing identical products and employing roughly the same number of ‘direct’ employees, i.e. directly involved in manufacturing.  The Operations Director randomly selected 9 weeks from the previous years production figures.  Each of the weeks chosen, employees worked 5 full days and no overtime.  The production figures for each facility is as follows (units in thousands)


	Ireland	Texas
1	3.8	3.7
2	3.9	3.8
3	4.0	3.6
4	3.7	3.3
5	3.6	3.4
6	4.1	3.5
7	3.9	3.6
8	4.0	3.7
9	4.1	3.4


(a)	You are required to construct a box plot for each factory’s output and to comment on the salient features of each plot.  Is there evidence from the box plots to reject the hypothesis that there is no difference in the production figures between the two facilities?  Use the box plot to justify your comments. 							(8 marks)

(b)	Compare and contrast the Mean and the Median as measures of location
(2 marks)

(c)	Two independent resistors are located in a simple circuit as shown below.  The probability that A and B works is 0.8 and 0.7 respectively.  You are required to calculate the probability that the signal will travel from x to y.  If the two resistors were arranged in series, what difference would this make to the probability of the signal reaching y?

(c)	A random sample of 100 parts (from (a) above) revealed that for 4 of those parts, the critical diameter measurements were outside spec.  You are requested to construct a 95% confidence interval for the proportion defective.
