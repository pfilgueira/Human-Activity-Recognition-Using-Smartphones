Pearson's chi-squared test

Pearson's chi-squared test uses a measure of goodness of fit which is the sum of differences between observed and expected outcome frequencies (that is, counts of observations), each squared and divided by the expectation:
\[ \chi^2 = \sum_{i=1}^n {\frac{(O_i - E_i)}{E_i}^2} \]
where:

\begin{itemize}
\item[Oi] = an observed frequency (i.e. count) for bin i
\item[Ei] = an expected (theoretical) frequency for bin i, asserted by the null hypothesis.
\end{itemize}
