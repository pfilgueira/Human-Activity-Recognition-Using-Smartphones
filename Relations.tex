\frametitle{Partial Orders}
There are two main kinds of relations that play a very
important role in mathematics and computer science:
1. Partial orders
2. Equivalence relations.

\begin{frame}
A binary relation, ≤, on a set, S, is
a partial order (or partial ordering) iﬀ it is reﬂexive,
transitive and antisymmetric, that is:

(1) (Reﬂexivity): a ≤ a, for all a $\in$ S;
(2) (Transitivity): If a ≤ b and b ≤ c, then a ≤ c, for
all a, b, c $\in$ S.
(3) (Antisymmetry): If a ≤ b and b ≤ a, then a = b, for
all a, b $\in$ S.
