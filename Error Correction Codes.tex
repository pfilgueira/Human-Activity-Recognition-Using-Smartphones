\section{Error Correction Codes}
Techniques that enable reliable delivery of digital data over reliable computer networks

Many channels are subject to channel noise, and so errors may be introduced during transmission.

\subsection{Error Detection}
Detection of Errors caused by noise or other impairments during transmission

\subsection{Error Correction}
Reconstruction of original error-free data
