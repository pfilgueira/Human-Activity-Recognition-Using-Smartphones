\section*{Normal Dsitribution - Short Questions}


\begin{enumerate}
\item 95\% of students at school weigh between 62 kg and 90 kg.
Assuming this data is normally distributed, what are the mean and standard deviation?

\item A machine produces electrical components.
99.7\% of the components have lengths between 1.176 cm and 1.224 cm.
Assuming this data is normally distributed, what are the mean and standard deviation?

\item 68\% of the marks in a test are between 51 and 64
Assuming this data is normally distributed, what are the mean and standard deviation?

\item The Fresha Tea Company pack tea in bags marked as 250 g
A large number of packs of tea were weighed and the mean and standard deviation were calculated as 255 g and 2.5 g respectively.
Assuming this data is normally distributed, what percentage of packs are underweight?

\item Students pass a test if they score 50\% or more.

The marks of a large number of students were sampled and the mean and standard deviation were calculated as 42\% and 8\% respectively.

Assuming this data is normally distributed, what percentage of students pass the test?
