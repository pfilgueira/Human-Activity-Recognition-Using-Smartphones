The following table gives the results of operations in a hospital according to the complexity of the
operation.

& & \\ \hline
Successful & 1990 & 950 \\ \hline
Unsuccessful & 10 & 50\\ \hline

Let A be the event that an operation is simple and B be the event that an
operation is successful. Calculate P r(B), P r(A|B), P r(A|BC ), P r(B|A) and
P r(B ∩ A).
