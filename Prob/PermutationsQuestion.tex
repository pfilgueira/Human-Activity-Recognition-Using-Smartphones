A college teaches a range of courses including maths, physics and IT.
Students choose a range of courses from these three subject areas. Currently 600
students are enrolled of whom 300 study maths courses, 120 study IT
and 380 study physics courses. 40 students study courses from all three subject
areas. 200 maths students study physics as well. 60 physics students
also study IT and 70 IT students also study maths. 20 students study physics and IT, but not maths.

How many students study none of these courses at all? (90)

How many students study maths but not physics or IT? (70)

How many students study both maths and physics but not IT? (160)

How many students study courses from precisely two of these subject
areas? (210)
