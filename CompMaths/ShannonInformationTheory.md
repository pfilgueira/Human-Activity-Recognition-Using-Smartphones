Shannon Information Theory
=============================================

Claude Shannon developed some mathematics, now often referred
to as “Information Theory,” that carefully quantified how
bits of data transmitted accurately from a source to a recipient can
reduce uncertainty by providing information. A great deal of the
computer networking equipment and software in the world today
- and especially the huge linked worldwide network we call the
Internet - is primarily concerned with this one basic task of getting
bits of information from a source to a destination.
