The Calculation Of The Trend (Moving average method).

Task 1

Using the steps described on the following page, calculate 7-day totals and then the moving average Trend.

Step 1

Sum the first seven admissions figures and place the result in the centre of the week (opposite Thursday) in the seven day total column.

Step 2

Drop the first day's admissions from your seven day total and then add those for the eighth day (Monday of week 2), placing the new total in the (Friday) of the seven day total column. We are calculating a moving 7-day Total.

Step 3

Repeat the process until the final seven day total, of week 3's admissions.

Step 4

Divide each of the totals by seven to give the moving average TREND.

Step 5

Plot the original data and the moving average on the same graph.

The next step would be to go on to the calculation of the "seasonal" - in this case daily - variations but for the moment we are confining our analysis to Trend calculations.
