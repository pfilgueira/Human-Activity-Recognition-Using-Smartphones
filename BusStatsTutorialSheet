A. Continuous Interest

A principal of â‚¬3,500 is invested with interest compounded continuously.
What is the required interest rate if the investment is to grow to \euro 6,250 after 5
years?

B) Histograms

(4 marks) Comment on the shape of the histogram. Based on the shape of the
histogram, what is the best measure of centrality and variability

Two types of histogram

Skewed
Symmetric

Median and Interquartile Range
Mean and Standard deviation ( or Variance)


C) Sampling without replacement

A lot of semiconductor chips contains 20 that are defective.

Two chips are selected at random, without replacement from the lot.


What is the probability that the first one is defective?

What is the probability that the second one is defective given that the first one was defective?

Independent events

What is the probability that the second one is defective given that the first chip was not defective?

What is the probability that both chips are defective.

D) Confidence interval for a mean

\bar{x}

Quantile

s sample standard deviation

sample size 

standard error  \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}



E) Quantiles computing Confidence intervals

Is the variance known?
Is the sample a large sample or small sample

is n \leq 30 ? small
is n > 30 large

F) Characteristics of Data sets

Range max and min
in Order?

G) Computing the Median of a data set
Odd size or even size data set

H) Effective Interest Rates

100 is subject to interest at 10% compounded quarterly. What is the accrued amount after one year?


I) The Choose operator

{n \choose k}  = {n! \over k! (n-k)!} 

J) Interquartile Range
