A. Continuous Interest

A principal of €3,500 is invested with interest compounded continuously.
What is the required interest rate if the investment is to grow to \euro 6,250 after 5
years?

B) Histograms

(4 marks) Comment on the shape of the histogram. Based on the shape of the
histogram, what is the best measure of centrality and variability

Two types of histogram

Skewed
Symmetric

Median and Interquartile Range
Mean and Standard deviation ( or Variance)


C) Sampling without replacement

A lot of semiconductor chips contains 20 that are defective.

Two chips are selected at random, without replacement from the lot.


What is the probability that the first one is defective?

What is the probability that the second one is defective given that the first one was defective?

Independent events

What is the probability that the second one is defective given that the first chip was not defective?

What is the probability that both chips are defective.


H) Effective Interest Rates

100 is subject to interest at 10% compounded quarterly. What is the accrued amount after one year?

Correlation


correlation coefficient must be between -1 and +1.

also it has no units. Also it is not a proportion, so it shouldnt be expreszed as a percentage.

D) Confidence interval for a mean

\bar{x}

Quantile

s sample standard deviation

sample size 

standard error  \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}



E) Quantiles computing Confidence intervals

Is the variance known?
Is the sample a large sample or small sample

is n \leq 30 ? small
is n > 30 large


Confidence intervals
point estimate 
sample mean
sample proportion
difference of two sample means
hypothesis testing
1 Write out null and alternative hypothesis
2 Compute test statistic 
	First need to compute the standard error.
3 Determine the quantile for critical value
4 Decision rule 
Important Considerations
Is the sample a small sample or large sample?
	Threshold n=30
		Small sample - use the student t distribution
		Large sample - use standard normal distribution
What is the significance level ? 
Is the procedure one tailed or two tailed? (k =1 or 2)

Standard Error p(100-p)`n





computing a v
Threshold value
alue based on a probability.
D
first we are hiven a probability vslue

then we find the z value
the 
n we use the standardisation formula to compute the probability.



the standard deviation is computed as follows.
