CHAPTER 3. LOGIC 43
are two general methods for tackling this type of problem; they are illustrated in the following two
examples.
Example 3.15 We use truth tables to simplify w : (p A ··q) V (p /\ q).
1 or z>A··q rw (1>A—¤1)V(rAq)
O O 1 0 O 0 _
0 1 O O 0 O
1 0 1 1 0 1
1 1 O O 1 1
From the table, we see that the column for the output in :-. (p A —¤q) V (p A q) is identical to the
column for p. Hence this network can be replaced by the input p, and no input q or gates are
necessary. El
Exzunple 3.16 `We use the laws of logic to simplify the expression for the final output w ;
(P/\rq)V(1>Aq)·
First note that we have “pA(something)" in both brackets, By the distributive law, we can take
“p/\" out of these brackets as "a common facto1·" and write: _
(ZJ/\o¢1)V(1¤Aq) :1*/\(‘·<1 VQ)-
Now (··q V q) : (q V ·¤q) : T, by the commutative law and the complement law. Thus
A w = p A T.
However, p /\ T : p, by the identity law. Hence we obtain w : p, as in the previous example. D

3, Let p, q be the following propositions.
pz This book is on Databases.
q: This bool: is on Programming.
Express each of the following cornpoundstatements symbolically in TWO different ways:
(a) This book is not on Databases or Programming.
(b) This book is not on Databases and Programming.
4. Use truth tables to prove that (p A q) V (-·pA q) : q. (Hint: you will need to construct
columns for p, q and p A q,-·p, —·pA q, (p A q) V (—·pA q). Remember to make a comment at
the end to say why the table proves that the two statements are logically equivalent.)

(b) lf rr : 5, then rz is positive.
(c) lf the quadrilateral is a square, then its four sides are equal.
l0. The basis for logical argument is that given propositions p,q, r such that p imples q and q
implies r, then we can deduce that p implies r. The validity of this argument depends upon
the fact that the statement [(11 ··> q) /\ (q —> r)] -+ (p —> r) is always true, that is, it is a
tautology.
Construct a truth table with columns for p,q, r and p -> q,q ·—> r, (p —> q) /\ (q —> r),p —>
r, Kp —-> q) /\ (q -->   —> (p -—> r). Hence prove that
