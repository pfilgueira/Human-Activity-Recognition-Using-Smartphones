\[ \mbox{E}(X) = \int^{u}_{l} x f(X) dx \]

\[ P(X \leq A)  = \int^{A}_{l} f(X) dx \]

\[ \mbox{Var}(X) = \int^{a}_{b} x f(X) dx \]


\[ \mu = \bar{x} \pm t_{(\nu,\sigma/2)}\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}  \]


\begin{itemize}
\item
\item Statistical Process Control is, in effect, continuous hypothesis testing. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Characteristics of Moving Averages}
\begin{itemize}
\item The different moving averages produce different results.
\item The greater the number of periods in the moving average, the greater the smoothing effect.
\end{itemize}

4) Process Capability Analysis
\begin{itemize}
\item Process Capability Indices
\item $C_{pk}$ and $C_{pm}$

\section{Cause and Effect Diagrams}

The Ishikawa diagram (also known as a fishbone diagram)
is used to associate multiple causes with a single effect.




%------------------------------------------------%

\section{Autocorrelation}

Autocorrelation can be detected using correlograms.



%------------------------------------------------%
\section{Control Charts for Attributes}

Control charts could also be prepared for \emph{\textbf{attributes}}, e.g. the proportion
showing the proportion that is defective in some way.
The Central line would be set at the average proportion defective expected, and 
the actual amount defective would be plotted on the chart.

\section{Dendrograms}
Dendrograms are also known as ``Tree Diagrams".

\section{Mutually Exclusive Events}
Mutually exclusive events are events that cannot happen at the same time.
\[ P(A and B) = P(A) + P(B) \]

	Type II error : probability of accepting a process as being in control, when in fact it is not.
	Based on the following OC

\section{Process Capability Analysis}


Process Capability Indices for a characteristic of interest from a continuous process can be
obtained using the command process.capability.

Lower and Upper Specification Limits must be specified.
\[  c_p = \frac{\mbox{USL} - \mbox{LSL} }{6 \times s} = \frac{12}{6 \times 1.956} = 1.02 \]

\[  c_{pk}\mbox{(upper)} =\frac{\mbox{USL} - \bar{x} }{3 \times s} = \frac{506-500.38}{3 \times 1.956} = 0.96\]

\[  c_{pk}\mbox{(lower)} =\frac{ \bar{x} -\mbox{USL} } {3 \times s} \] 


\[  c_{pk}\mbox{(lower)} = \frac{500.38-494}{3 \times 1.956} = 104\]

\section{The Stepping Stone Method}

\begin{itemize}
\item Start at a cell that has no allocation. (This cell will be a ``plus" cell)
\item Choose a cell that has received an allocation (This cell will be a ``minus" cell)
\item Right Angle Turn - 
\item Keep going until you have returned to the origin cell.
