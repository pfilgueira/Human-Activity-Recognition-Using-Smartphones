The daily concentration of a certain pollutant in a stream 
has an exponential distribution with a daily mean of 
200mg /l Suppose that the problem of pollution will occur if the 
concentration of the pollutant exceeds 6 mg/l. 

\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)] What is the probability of pollution resulting from this pollutant in a single 
day?
\item[(b)] What is the return period (in days) associated with this concentration level 
of 6 mg/l? 
\item[(c)] What is the probability thatthis pollution problem will occur at most once in 
the next 3 days?
\end{itemize}

%d) Generate, by Monte Carlo simulation, a realisation of daily concentrations 
%of this pollutant over a period of100 days, and check your answer to 
%question c) with this generated dataset
